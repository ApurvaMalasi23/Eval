# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by AI models.

We will provide you with the user prompt and an AI-generated responses.
You should first read the user prompt carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on and Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.

You will assign the writing response a score from -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your scoring, and only choose scores from -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing the verbosity of the model's response, which measures its conciseness and ability to provide sufficient detail without being overly wordy or excessively brief.

## Criteria Definition
Verbosity: The response is appropriately concise, providing sufficient detail without using complex language to thoroughly address the prompt without being overly wordy or excessively brief.

## Rating Rubric
2: (Too verbose). The response is excessively long and filled with unnecessary words and repetition, making it very challenging to extract the relevant information. The response could be drastically shortened to improve clarity and conciseness.
1: (Somewhat verbose). The response contains some unnecessary wordiness or repetition, making it slightly longer than ideal. However, it still provides all necessary information and is generally easy to understand.
0: (Just right). The response is perfectly concise, providing all necessary information in a clear and succinct manner without any unnecessary wordiness or repetition.
-1: (Somewhat brief). The response is slightly brief and could benefit from additional details or explanations to fully address the prompt. However, it still provides the core information and is generally understandable.
-2: (Too short). The response is excessively brief and lacks crucial information or explanations needed to adequately address the prompt. It leaves the reader with unanswered questions or a sense of incompleteness.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Assess completeness: Does the response provide all the necessary information to thoroughly address the prompt? Are there any key points missing or left unexplained? 
STEP 2: Assess conciseness: Is the response free of unnecessary wordiness, repetition, or filler words? Could any sentences or phrases be shortened or simplified without losing meaning? 
STEP 3: Assess overall balance: Does the response strike the right balance between providing sufficient detail and being concise? Is it appropriately informative without being overly long or excessively brief?
